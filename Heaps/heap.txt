Complete/Perfect Binary Tree : All levels are comppletely filled
Almost Complete Binary Tree : 
    Perfect BT w/o the last levels and the last level filled from left to right
    Leaves should be present only on last and 2nd last level

HEAP DATA STRUCTURE
1. Complete Tree
** We can have n ary Heaps as well in case of n ary Tree **
2. Heap Property
    Parent is bigger/smaller than its childs for MAX/MIN Heap respectively

Binomial Heap
Fibonacci Heap
Leftist Heap


For Binary Tree
1. Children
    Parent -> i
    1st Child -> 2i+1
    2nd Child -> 2i+2
2.  Parent
    Child -> i
    Parent -> lower  [i/2]


Facts
1. Height of Tree -> h

    No of nodes at height h -> 2^h
    Total No. of Nodes -> 2^(h+1) -1

2. No of Internal Nodes = No of leaves - 1

3. Height of Tree -> lower [log 2 N]        for binary Tree
